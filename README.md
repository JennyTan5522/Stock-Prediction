Stock Prediction is a time series forecasting on the stock prices. Two datasets are selected from Kaggle, which are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM). LSTM and SVR are the models used to perform stock prediction.  

The Stacked LSTM model is used to perform forecasting on the full JNJ dataset and the RMSE values obtained for the training set and testing set are 0.2167 and 2.3747 whereas 
the MAPE values obtained are 1.7414% and 1.2100%. Stacked LSTM is also used for forecasting the average stock prices of the full XOM dataset and the training set obtained an RMSE value of 0.2550 and 0.9429 for the test set. The RMSE of the SVR model of the training set and testing set are 14.3198 and 19.8299 respectively whereas the MAPE values are 
66.8251% and 27.4985%.
